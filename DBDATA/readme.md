# Database import
File for importing the database for TAS.

## Users
Premade users student monitor and admin can login with password: 1234567
Those users have their roles predefined so you can start to test the system.
If you would like to start fresh without any users you should setup a monitor-user and a admin-user by making their roles MONITOR or ADMIN, after registration, in the database.

## installation
Simply import the tas.sql into your phpmyadmin and you should be good to go.
